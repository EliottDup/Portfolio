        My name is Eliott Duparc and I am now
        <span class="highlight age">17</span> years old. <br />
        I was born in France and moved to the Netherlands when I was
        <span class="highlight">9</span>. I currently study at the
        <span class="highlight">Metis Montessori Lyceum</span> and plan to study
        <span class="highlight">Computer Science</span> or something of the like
        later on. I started to learn programming at the
        <span class="hightlight">Metis Montessori Lyceum</span>, in the
        <span class="highlight">Coderclass</span>, a special class more oriented
        towards programming. Shortly after moving to the Netherlands, I also
        started <span class="highlight">Freerunning</span>.

            For the GMTK Game Jam of 2023, which had the theme "roles reversed",
            me and a friend worked together on making a game in p5.js. The end
            result was a fun little two-player game in where you hunt each other
            down in a maze while trying to find the exit.

            <br />
            Looper Inc. is a bit of a passion project that started in 2022, when
            I made a game for school. Sadly, shortly after finishing the game,
            my computer's SSD drive broke, and the game was lost. The game was
            not very impressive in any kind of way, as it was made in only 4
            months, and it was my first time ever designing and making an actual
            game. Looper Inc. aims to be a remake and, if possible, a
            finalisation of the game.<br />
            <br />
            But now about the game. <br />
            <br />
            Looper Inc. is a movement based game inspired by games such as
            Karlson and Titanfall 2, featuring high-speed movement and parkour.
            However, it also features a unique mechanic: Time Travel. <br />
            The method of time travel is inspired by the movie Tenet, instead of
            jumping through time, time runs normally or appears to run
            backwards.
            <br /><br />
            Development is still in its earliest stages and scince I do not have
            much free time to spend on this project, this project is not ready
            to be finished anytime soon
